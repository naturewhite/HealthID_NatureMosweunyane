To create the Health ID generator solution, I opted for Java as the programming language using JDK 1.8 and Eclipse Enterprise
for development. The solution is starightfoward program with no external dependencies. I chose the language due to my strong expertise and deep familiarity with the language, ensuring a highly effective and comfortable approach to complete the task.
The program was designed to be scalable , capable of handling increased workload or data volume without modification and also optimized performance.



1. use cmd to test the solution
    a. double click on the start.bat
    b. You should be seeing cmd 
    b. The program should start with messages to guide you on what to do

2. To run the code
   -> Import  the project into eclipse -> General ->Project from folder or archive -> import source: /HealthID_NatureMosweunyane/HeathIDIssuance
   -> Go inside the src/identifier package
   -> Open GenerateIdentifier.java : This is where the main method is
   -> Right click and select  Run as -> Java Application


Thank you!
